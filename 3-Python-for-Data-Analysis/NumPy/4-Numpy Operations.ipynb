Hence, a non-computationally-optimal function can become a huge bottleneck in your algorithm and can take result in a model that takes ages to run. To make sure that the code is computationally efficient, we will use vectorization.\n",

    "Vectorized code has many advantages, among which are:\n",
    "- vectorized code is more concise and easier to read\n",
    "- fewer lines of code generally means fewer bugs\n",
    "- the code more closely resembles standard mathematical notation (making it easier, typically, to correctly code mathematical constructs)\n",

    "### 4.4. Universal Array Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A universal function (or ufunc for short) is a function that operates on ndarrays in an element-by-element fashion, supporting array broadcasting, type casting, and several other standard features. That is, a ufunc is a “vectorized” wrapper for a function that takes a fixed number of specific inputs and produces a fixed number of specific outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In NumPy, universal functions are instances of the numpy.ufunc class. Many of the built-in functions are implemented in compiled C code. The basic ufuncs operate on scalars, but there is also a generalized kind for which the basic elements are sub-arrays (vectors, matrices, etc.), and broadcasting is done over other dimensions. One can also produce custom ufunc instances using the frompyfunc factory function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are currently more than 60 universal functions defined in numpy on one or more types, covering a wide variety of operations. Some of these ufuncs are called automatically on arrays when the relevant infix notation is used (e.g., add(a, b) is called internally when a + b is written and a or b is an ndarray). Nevertheless, you may still want to use the ufunc call in order to use the optional output argument(s) to place the output(s) in an object (or objects) of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions include standard trigonometric functions, functions for arithmetic operations, handling complex numbers, statistical functions, etc. Numpy comes with many [universal array functions](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html), which are essentially just mathematical operations you can use to perform the operation across the array. Let's show some common ones:"
