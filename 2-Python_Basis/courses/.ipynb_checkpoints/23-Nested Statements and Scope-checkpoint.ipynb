    "# Nested Namespaces in Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace is a collection of names. In Python, you can imagine a namespace as a mapping of every name, you have defined, to corresponding objects. They’re usually implemented as Python dictionaries, although this is abstracted away ( __dict__ ).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated.\n",
    "- A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long we don't exit. This is the reason that built-in functions like id(), print() etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each module creates its own global namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "These different namespaces are isolated. Hence, the same name that may exist in different modules do not collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can have various functions and classes. A local namespace is created when a function is called, which has all the names defined in it. Similar, is the case with class. Following diagram may help to clarify this concept.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you create a variable name in Python the name is stored in a *name-space*. Variable names also have a *scope*, the scope determines the visibility of that variable name to other parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the idea of scope can be described by 3 general rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Name assignments will create or change local names by default.\n",
    "2. Name references search (at most) four scopes, these are:\n",
    "    * local\n",
    "    * enclosing functions\n",
    "    * global\n",
    "    * built-in\n",
    "3. Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes."
