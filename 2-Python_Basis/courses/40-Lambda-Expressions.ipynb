    "Function objects returned by running lambda expressions work exactly the same as those created and assigned by defs. There is key difference that makes lambda useful in specialized roles:\n",

    "**Lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements.**\n",

    "* The lambda's body is similar to what we would put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general that a def. We can only squeeze design, to limit program nesting. lambda is designed for coding simple functions, and def handles the larger tasks."
